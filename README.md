# BridgeMap
A source to source compiler. BridgeMap language to SQL.


## BridgeMap language
`It is a python based interpreter that can convert a classical function into view or a PLSQL block`


1. #### What is it 🤔?
    - A **_"python like"_** programming language that can be straight away converted into a SQL procedure block.
    - If you have written a function in any language, then you could code this easily.

2. #### Who is going to use this 😵‍💫?
    - If you are a programming guy, but, you are not familier with SQL syntax. But you want a simple stored procedures.

3. #### Inspired by 💡
    - Highly inspire by [Language Integrated Query - LINQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/linq/) By [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/)
